### c8: 🔴 0/10

**Type:** assessment | **Importance:** ★★★★☆

> P.M. Lee's remarks generally confirmed the position taken by Mr. Goh regarding the withdrawal of NZ forces.

**Justification:** The analyst explicitly stated they were unable to answer the question directly related to this claim.

**Evidence from:** t8

---

### c10: 🔴 0/10

**Type:** attribution | **Importance:** ★★★☆☆

> Air Commodore Gunton (Commander New Zealand Forces Singapore) confirmed the position regarding the withdrawal of NZ forces to DAO in a separate conversation.

**Justification:** The analyst explicitly stated they were unable to answer the question directly related to this claim.

**Evidence from:** t10

---

### c12: 🔴 0/10

**Type:** assessment | **Importance:** ★★★★★

> The implication was that stationing foreign forces in the area was an outmoded way of dealing with communist subversion and insurgency.

**Justification:** The reconstruction directly contradicts the claim. Instead of implying that foreign forces were an outmoded way of dealing with communist threats, the analyst's answers repeatedly state that PM Lee stressed the political importance and necessity of maintaining foreign military presences for regional stability and to counter communist threats.

**Evidence from:** t12, t13, q2, q4, q5, th3, synthesis

---

### c13: 🔴 0/10

**Type:** assessment | **Importance:** ★★★★★

> The implication was that stationing foreign forces in the area was not an especially relevant way of dealing with communist subversion and insurgency.

**Justification:** The reconstruction directly contradicts the claim. Instead of implying that foreign forces were not an especially relevant way of dealing with communist threats, the analyst's answers repeatedly state that PM Lee stressed the political importance and necessity of maintaining foreign military presences for regional stability and to counter communist threats.

**Evidence from:** t12, t13, q2, q4, q5, th3, synthesis

---

### c3: 🔴 1/10

**Type:** attribution | **Importance:** ★★★★☆

> Dawson said Deputy P.M. Talboys had been the first to raise the question of continued stationing of NZ forces in Singapore.

**Justification:** The reconstruction mentions a New Zealand official (PM Kirk) discussing NZ forces, but attributes a different action (reaffirming intentions) to a different person than the claim (Talboys first raising the question). The High Commissioner's name is also different.

**Evidence from:** t3

---

### c11: 🟡 4/10

**Type:** attribution | **Importance:** ★★★★★

> Dawson said Lee indicated that the best way to counter the communist threat to SEA was through economic development of the ASEAN countries.

**Justification:** While the reconstruction mentions PM Lee's views on open trading relationships and loose regional groupings (economic aspects), it does not explicitly state these as 'the best way to counter the communist threat' through 'economic development of the ASEAN countries.' The specific attribution to Dawson is also missing.

**Evidence from:** t11, q4, th3, synthesis

---

### c9: 🟡 5/10

**Type:** assessment | **Importance:** ★★★★☆

> Both P.M. Lee and Deputy P.M. Goh were quite willing to accommodate GNZ desires concerning the timing of the withdrawal of these forces.

**Justification:** The reconstruction indicates PM Lee's willingness to discuss and plan for a phased withdrawal, suggesting accommodation of timing. However, it explicitly states no information was found regarding Deputy PM Goh's disposition, making the reconstruction only partial.

**Evidence from:** t9, q2, q3, synthesis

---

### c7: 🟢 8/10

**Type:** assessment | **Importance:** ★★☆☆☆

> P.M. Lee was 'somewhat more oblique' in his remarks regarding the withdrawal of NZ forces.

**Justification:** The reconstruction captures the essence of PM Lee's remarks being indirect or nuanced by detailing his 'inconsistent public stance' and how his public statements were 'interpreted as an attempt to convey an impression,' which aligns with being 'somewhat more oblique.'

**Evidence from:** t7, synthesis

---

### c2: 🟢 9/10

**Type:** assessment | **Importance:** ★★★☆☆

> There were somewhat differing versions in reftels concerning the degree of GOS initiative in requesting the withdrawal of NZ forces from Singapore.

**Justification:** The reconstruction accurately identifies an 'inconsistency' in PM Lee's statements regarding the presence/withdrawal of NZ forces, capturing the essence of 'differing versions' from the GOS perspective. It provides specific examples of this inconsistency (public vs. private stance).

**Evidence from:** t2, t7, synthesis
