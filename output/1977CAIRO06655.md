## Claim Evaluations

### c1: 🔴 0/10

**Type:** attribution | **Importance:** ★★★☆☆

> The Egyptian Ambassador in Addis may be the source of the reported presence of Cuban military personnel in Ethiopia.

**Justification:** The reconstruction completely missed the specific detail about the Egyptian Ambassador in Addis being the potential source. Instead, it identified a 'Department Spokesman' and the 'U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa' as sources.

**Evidence from:** t1, t2, c_q2, synthesis

---

### c2: 🔴 0/10

**Type:** assessment | **Importance:** ★★★☆☆

> The Egyptian Ambassador in Addis may be exaggerating the number of Cuban military personnel in Ethiopia.

**Justification:** The reconstruction contains no information about the Egyptian Ambassador in Addis, nor any assessment of an ambassador exaggerating the number of Cuban military personnel. It discusses other diplomats denying or understating numbers, which is the opposite.

**Evidence from:** t2, c_q5, synthesis

---

### c7: 🔴 0/10

**Type:** assessment | **Importance:** ★★★★☆

> The GOE is exaggerating the number of Cuban military personnel in Ethiopia.

**Justification:** The reconstruction explicitly states 'Unable to answer' for the question directly related to this claim (t7). Furthermore, the information provided about the GOE consistently indicates they were *denying* or *understating* the military presence (claiming development roles), which is the opposite of exaggerating the number of military personnel.

**Evidence from:** t7, c_q2, c_q3, c_q5, synthesis

---

### c3: 🔴 1/10

**Type:** attribution | **Importance:** ★★★★☆

> The Cuban Ambassador in Cairo is admitting information to diplomatic colleagues.

**Justification:** The analyst explicitly stated 'Unable to answer' for the question directly asking about this claim (t3). While 'Cuban diplomats' are mentioned sharing information on the 'local diplomatic circuit' in c_q5, this is placed in Addis Ababa, not Cairo, and describes them denying military presence, not admitting information. The specific details of the claim are missed.

**Evidence from:** t3, c_q5, th3

---

### c6: 🔴 2/10

**Type:** assessment | **Importance:** ★★★★☆

> The Cuban Ambassador is annoyed at the GOE.

**Justification:** The reconstruction correctly identifies that an ambassador was expressing displeasure with the Ethiopian government (GOE). However, it incorrectly attributes this sentiment to 'Ambassador Young' (the US Ambassador to the UN) instead of 'The Cuban Ambassador,' which is a significant factual error regarding the identity of the annoyed party.

**Evidence from:** t6, synthesis

---

### c4: 🟡 4/10

**Type:** event | **Importance:** ★★★★★

> There are somewhere between twenty and thirty Cuban military personnel in Ethiopia.

**Justification:** The reconstruction correctly identifies the presence of Cuban military personnel in Ethiopia and provides a specific number. However, the number consistently reported (approximately 50) is significantly different from the original claim's range (between twenty and thirty).

**Evidence from:** t1, t2, t4, c_q1, c_q2, synthesis

---

### c5: 🟢 10/10

**Type:** logistics | **Importance:** ★★★★☆

> The Cuban military personnel in Ethiopia are serving as advisers.

**Justification:** The reconstruction perfectly captures that the Cuban military personnel were serving as advisors. It consistently uses the term 'military advisors' and further specifies their role in 'training militia,' which aligns perfectly with the claim.

**Evidence from:** t1, t2, t4, t5, c_q1, c_q2, c_q3, c_q4, synthesis
