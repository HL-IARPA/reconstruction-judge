> Quai Director for Africa (Georgy) returned from two days of intensive consultations in Moscow on Africa, August 9-10.

**Type:** assessment | **Importance:** ★★★★★

> Georgy thinks the Soviets are currently taking one step back in Africa to avoid confrontation with the West.

**Justification:** The reconstruction describes a pragmatic approach by Soviets (allowing Western economic aid while maintaining political control) which could be interpreted as a form of 'stepping back' from direct confrontation. However, the specific phrasing 'one step back' and the attribution to Georgy are missing. The official mentioned is Journiac.

**Evidence from:** t2, th1, synthesis

---

**Evidence from:** t9, q3, synthesis

---

### c4: 🟡 7/10
