      "justification": "The reconstruction completely missed the specific detail about the Egyptian Ambassador in Addis being the potential source. Instead, it identified a 'Department Spokesman' and the 'U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa' as sources.",

While 'Cuban diplomats' are mentioned sharing information on the 'local diplomatic circuit' in c_q5, this is placed in Addis Ababa, not Cairo, and describes them denying military presence, not admitting information. The specific details of the claim are missed.",
