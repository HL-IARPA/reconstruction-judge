The names 'Guo Li', 'William Guo', 'VISNEWS', 'Wei Jingsheng', the specific amount 'one million dollars', or the specific attribution 'Chinese sources told foreign experts' are entirely missing.

However, the specific 'story' being encouraged is different (the 'Antiparty Conspiratorial Clique' colluding with the Soviet Union) from the one in the original claim (the Guo Li story).",

      "justification": "The reconstruction clearly states that a purpose for 'official promotion of the narrative' is 'concerning external participation in activist groups' and to 'justify the arrest and legal prosecution of individuals who get close to foreigners'. This substantially captures the idea of the story being encouraged as an example of 'foreign involvement in the dissident movement', although the specific 'story' is not named.",
